NEW: ProFx AC97 Plugin

http://members.home.nl/nahutec/kxplugins/profx_ac97.png

Introduction;
Besides saving DSP resources, the major goal of the ProFx plugins is
to 'bypass' kX Mixer pages as much as possible so we can work at,
and focus on one place;...the DSP window.
[SRC] works fine, but when a ac97 source is selected, a user still
has to go to kX Mixer's ac97 page to make some adjustments.

All and all I think it's better to have 1 single plugin dealing with AC97 inputs;

- User can now select Left/Right AC97 Recording Sources independantly.
- on Audigy 1/2 cards, UDA device (second and better codec) can be
 'switched on' giving a total of 4 mono analog input signals.
- AC97/UDA settings are conveniently stored in plugin's user presets.
- All 'muso' relevant ac97 controls can be accessed from plugin's UI.

How it works;
Upon loading the plugin automaticly detects card type (10k1 or 10k2)
and the presence of AC97 and UDA device.
It bails out if no ac97 device is found (i.e. APS since it has no AC97 device).
After that, the AC97 hardware is reset, and the default preset loaded.
On Audigy cards the plugin has 4 outputs; AC97_L/R and UDA_L/R.
On 10k1 cards it has 2 outputs; AC97_L/R.
All controls write directly to the hardware, so DSP usage is very low.

Usage;
Since current [SRC] also has ac97 inputs, you can not use it in conjunction with [AC97].
That's why I wrote an alternative [SRC] version without ac97 inputs.
It is included in the download.
The rest is pretty straight forward.

Installation;
Download and unzip AC97.KXL and SRC.KXL.

Register them both. The new [SRC] overwrites the existing one.
You can verify the newer [SRC] in that it has no ac97 capabilities.

Compatibilty;
Compiled for 3538.
[AC97] should work fine with all CL 10k1 cards.
I have tested the plugin succesfully on an Audigy 1 and 2 OEM,
but I can't tell if it works on later adg2 cards.
As usual; this is a beta version. Use at own risk and if you know what you are doing.
Please report bugs and if it works (or not) on newer Audigy 2 cards.

PS:
To all 'skin fans';
I will skin the plug after it prooves itself to be functional/usefull.
I wrote a kind of 'generic' and scalable skin so I probably do it with the rest.

PPS:
For those who don't know;
There is absolutly no use in loading more the one instance of [AC97].
(Kinda like loading two Epilogs or two Prologs)
