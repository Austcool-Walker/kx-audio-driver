<h3>kX Plans and initiatives / User contribution</h3>

<p class=Darken>What are the recent changes in the kX Project?</p>

<h4>We are glad our user base has increased significantly. Keeping project up-and-running
requires a lot of human resources and a lot of time. Our new initiative is to encourage
kX Users to take part in the project. There are several ways one can participate:<br>
 <ul>
  <li>you can help us to translate the driver help and interface into <? klink("trans"); ?>different languages</a>
  <li>you can contribute <? klink("skins"); ?>new skin files</a>
  <li>you can become a <? klink("beta"); ?>beta-tester</a> and test particular driver features
  <li>you can share your experience with the driver, <? klink("forums"); ?>tell us</a> about any new uses of the software
  <li>you can help us to answer user questions posted on our <? klink("forums"); ?>forum</a>
  <li>you can contribute to our 'Knowledgebase' project (see below)
 </ul>
</h4>

<p class=Darken>What is 'kX Knowledgebase'?</p>

<h4>Our driver has a lot of features -- some of them aren't even known to the 
  majority of our users due to the main problem: our documentation is incomplete.
  Our new initiative is to start a 'Knowledgebase' project: everybody is encouraged to
  share his/her ideas on using the driver. Moreover, the knowledgebase will have sections
  dealing with ASIO, Cubase, Sonar, AC-3 Movies, Games etc, etc, etc...
</h4>

<h4>At the moment we need to appoint certain people to act as Knowledgebase coordinators:
  they will need to collect, check, edit and publish any articles submitted by our users.
  Each coordinator will be responsible for the particular section. If you wish to help us,
  please feel free to drop a message to our <? klink("forums");?> Support Forum</a>.
</h4>

<h4>Please visit <a href='https://www.github.com/kxproject/kX-Audio-driver-Documentation' target=_blank class=fade>kX Knowledgebase</a> for details.
</h4>

<p class=Darken>Any more ideas?</p>

<h4>YES! We are about to start a new preset/settings sharing system. The users will be able
 to share their presets and kX Settings, add screenshots and description and so on.
 We are sure this will help us to increase overall usage of the driver features and make
 the users aware of the (practically :)) infinite possibilities of our software. This system
 is currently under development -- we'll keep you informed on our progress.
</h4>

<h4>kX Project is an independent development effort which highly relies on user activity.
  Without your contribution, the overall efficiency of our work will be low. 
  Managing kX Project won't be too difficult task for us provided we are supported 
  by the kX Community!
  We are very interested to receive feedback from you. Please share your ideas by
  posting to our <? klink("forums"); ?>support forum</a> or by sending us an e-mail.
