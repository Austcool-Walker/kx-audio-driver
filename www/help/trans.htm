<h3>kX Translation Guide</h3>

<h4>

<p>There are two main fields of work: to translate the kX Documentation and to translate 
   the kX Audio Driver interface. You can choose any field you wish. If you wish to
   translate the documentation, please go to our <?klink("forums");?>Support Forum</a> and
   find a topic dealing with documentation translations.</p>

<p>If you want to localize the kX Audio Driver, do the following:</p>

<ul>
 <li>send a message to <? contact_link(); ?> in order to get the latest release (or check our <? klink("forums");?>Support Forum</a> for the latest development release currently available)</li>
 <li>add (or update) a translation for your native language as shown below</li>
</ul>

<p>After you download the very recent release, run the installation program - it will extract
kX Project files (typically, in C:\Program Files\kX Project\35xx folder). Note: it is not
necessary to <b>install</b> the driver, just unpack the installation files! Now you should find
the file 'kxskin.kxs': it is actually a WinRar archive. Rename the file into 'kxskin.rar' and
use <a href='http://www.rarsoft.com' target=_blank class=fade>WinRar</a> to unpack the file. You will
need only -one- file from this archive, 'lang.ini'. After you get the file, open it in any
text editor (such as NotePad) and add/update the translation the following way:

<pre>

/// an example:

function=Event:
function.222='your translation here'

</pre>

<p>
 <i>Note:</i> instead of '222' you should use your locale number.<br>
 For example, for Russian it is '419', for German it is '407' and so on.<br>
 The full list of language codes is available <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/winxp/xp-lcid.asp" target=_blank>here</a>
 or <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/winxp/xp-lcid.mspx target=_new>here</a>.
</p>

<p>Don't forget to specify your name and e-mail address in the very beginning of the 'lang.ini' file
in order to be mentioned on our 'credits' page.</p>

<p>You can test your translation by 'updating' the 'kxskin.kxs' archive with your 
new 'lang.ini' file. Sometimes, however, you will not be able to see the results until your 
language is supported via 'Language' menu by the mixer.</p>

<p>When your translation is done, e-mail us your custom lang.ini file to be included in 
the next release of the kX Audio Driver (<b>please use WinRar or WinZip to avoid
any problems with encoding!</b>).</p>
