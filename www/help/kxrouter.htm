<p><b>kX Router</b></p>
<hr>
<p><b>Overview</b><br>
<br>
  </b>The kX Router applet is activated from the <a href="mixer.htm">kX
Mixer</a> or from the <a href="menu.htm">kX Menu</a>. This applet displays and lets you change how and where the 
  audio streams from within the system are mapped to the 16 <a href="dspguide.htm#fxbus">FXBusses</a> in the
<a href="dspguide.htm">kX DSP</a> applet.</p>
<p><b>Audio Streams and the
kX Router&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Software outputs include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wave Left and Right (Windows Multimedia WinMM
    subsystem)</li>
  <li>DirectSound2D voices (hardware-accelerated)</li>
  <li>DirectSound3D voices (hardware-accelerated)</li>
  <li>AC3 voices (5+1)</li>
  <li>16 MIDI channels</li>
  <li>16 ASIO output channels</li>
</ul>
<p>These software outputs are grouped as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Group 1. Wave Left/Right and DirectSound 2D
    voices (stereo or mono)</li>
  <li>Group 2. DirectSound3D and AC3 voices (they
    use only one mono output that is split by the driver to 2,4 or 6 channels);</li>
  <li>Group 3. 16 MIDI channels</li>
  <li>Group 4. 16 ASIO channels</li>
</ul>
<p><img  src="images/techni2.gif" ></p>
<p>These groups can have different routings,
including 16 different routings for MIDI channels and 16 for <a href="asio.htm">ASIO</a>
channels (all controllable separately).<br>
<br>
Each software voice is hardware-routed to 4 different FXBuses. These routings
are called 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and each send amount can be
individually adjusted. Send amounts are called 'send_a', 'send_b', 'send_c'
and 'send_d'. Four additional FXBuses are added in the case of 10k2 cards ('E',
'F', 'G' and 'H'), for a total of 8. These amounts can be controlled
by the sliders on the <a href="fxlevels.htm">Fx Amounts</a> page of the <a href="mixer.htm">kX
Mixer</a>.<br>
<br>
Note that Wave, DirectSound and MIDI routings require send_a and send_b to be
reserved by the kX driver to perform stereo panning. Therefore, the user can
control only the send_c and send_d amounts (although all 'routings' are
controllable). For ASIO voices, all 4 amounts are controllable (8 for 10k2
cards) via the sliders in the <a href="asio.htm">kX ASIO control</a> applet.<br>
<br>
The default configuration allows panning of stereo sources using standard
Windows / DirectX / Midi methods (handled internally by send_a and send_b), and
to use send_c and send_d as 'FX Send Amounts'. Sends c and d are mapped to
Reverb and Chorus by default, and controllable via MIDI Controllers as well as
kX Mixer sliders.<br>
<br>
Once a signal is modified by the send amounts and is routed to its target FX
bus, it can then be controlled via <a href="dspguide.htm">kX DSP</a> applet.
</p>

<p><b>Using kX Router</b></p>
<p>The kX Router functions
are very similar to the <a href="asio.htm">ASIO routing window</a>
functions, although there are no signal amount sliders present in the kX Router.

<p><b>Tips 
  and tricks</b></p>
<p>Router settings are 
  unique for each installed soundcard. The currently selected soundcard is displayed
in the lower right corner of the window. Card selection may be changed by
clicking on the device name display box.</p>
