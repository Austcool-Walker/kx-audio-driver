<h3>kX Fund -- Donate!</h3>

<h4>
<p>Many long hours of hard work have gone into the development of the kX Project thus far, 
and although the kX Audio Driver is a FREE download, any donations which you might be willing 
to make would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Of course there is absolutely no requirement that you make a donation - it is entirely up 
to you - and the kX driver will remain a free download.</p>

<p>However, if you find that the kX Drivers are useful to you, or you simply wish to encourage 
the developers by making a monetary contribution (and are able to do so), then please 
make a PayPal/WebMoney donation (in any amount) to the kX Project.</p>

<p>As one of our contributors has pointed out, if all satisfied kX users would 
make even a very modest donation (say $10 each), it would go a long way 
towards deferring our costs and would further encourage development of new 
features (and elimination of old bugs).
</p>

<p>
A big thank you goes out to those of you who have already made donations to the kX project.<br>
At the same time, as long as work continues there will be costs to be paid 
(such as webhosting, Audigy2 etc.) and of course your continuing donations will always 
provide additional incentive and motivation to the kX team, to keep on doing what 
they've been doing all along - namely providing free high-performance WDM drivers 
for the 10kx cards.</p>

<p>You can use any credit card accepted by the PayPal system.
(VISA, MasterCard, Discover, AmericanExpress).</p>

<p>You can also use <a href='http://www.wmtransfer.com/' target=_blank>WebMoney Transfer</a> system.
(Russian users click here: <a href='http://www.webmoney.ru/' target=_blank>WebMoney</a>. Note: WebMoney 
allows you to transfer money across Russia using any local 'Sberkassa' :).
