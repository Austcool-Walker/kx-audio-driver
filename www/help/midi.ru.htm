<h3>Present kX Audio Driver MIDI implementation:</h3>

<pre> 
 0x80 note off
 0x90 note on / off
       Velocity affects Filter Cutoff according to SoundFont 2.01 specification:
       (8.4.2 MIDI Note-On Velocity to Filter Cutoff (-2400 cents))
       for velocities less than 64: Filter Cutoff -= (64-velocity)*2400/64 (0..2400 cents)
 0xa0 key pressure (realtime velocity change)
 0xb0 controller
 0xc0 program change
 0xd0 channel pressure (realtime modulation change)
       MIDI Channel Pressure affects Vibrato LFO Pitch Depth [50 cents / max excursion]
       (according to SoundFont 2.01 specification, 8.4.3)
 0xe0 pitchbend
 0xf0, 0xf7 sysex

 MIDI Controllers:

  0 - bank LSB
       see #32
  1 - modulation
       MIDI Continuous Controller 1 affects Vibrato LFO Pitch Depth [50 cents / max excursion]
       (according to SoundFont 2.01 specification, 8.4.4)
       in 'Legacy mode' affects Modulation LFO Pitch Depth (18 * Modulation CC) / 1200
  2 - breath [under development]
  4 - foot [under development]
  5 - portamento time [under development]
  6 - data entry
  7 - volume
  8 - balance
       stereo balance
       doesn't change instrument positions
  10 - pan
        affects stereo samples in generic way
  11 - expression
  16 - General Purpose 1 [10k2 SendE Amount]
  17 - General Purpose 2 [10k2 SendF Amount]
  18 - General Purpose 3 [10k2 SendG Amount]
  19 - General Purpose 4 [10k2 SendH Amount]
  32 - bank MSB
        supports 'mixed' programming model
        resulting bank number is: LSB+MSB,
        thus, 254 banks are accessible and both 'LSB only' & 'MSB only' modes are supported
        kX Mixer supports 251 (0..250) banks
        this behaviour might change in the future...
  38 - data entry
  64 - sustain
  65 - portamento on/off [under development]
  66 - sostenuto
  67 - soft pedal 
       implemented via Filter Cutoff:
       if active, Filter Cutoff is increased by 0x9e (158) - that is, gives 9000 cents
       (that is, Filter Cutoff frequency is decreased)
  68 - legato 
       if active, sets Attack time to 0
  69 - hold2 
        implemented via Modulation / Volume Envelope Release Time
        if active, Modulation / Volume Envelope Release Time is increased by 1900 timecents
  71 - sound resonance
        implemented via Filter Q (0..15 units)
        0 - resonance is decreased by 15 units
        64 - default
        127 - resonance is increased by 15 units
  72 - sound release
        implemented via Volume Envelope Release Time
        0 - release time is decreased by 2400 timecents
        64 - default
        127 - release time is increased by 2400 timecents
  73 - sound attack
        implemented via Volume Envelope Attack time (0..127 units)
        0 - attack time is decreased by 64 units
        64 - default
        127 - attack time is increased by 64 units
        (log-encoded)
  74 - sound brightness 
        implemented via Filter Cutoff
        0 - Filter Cutoff frequency increases (minimum effect depth)
        64 - default; 
        127 - Filter Cutoff frequency decreases (maximum effect depth)
  84 - portamento control [under development]
  91 - reverb level
        implemented according to SoundFont 2.01 specification:
        8.4.8 MIDI Continuous Controller 91 to Reverb Effects Send
        Amount equals to 200 tenths of a percent
        that is, 127 gives 20% reverb increase
  92 - tremulo level [under development]
  93 - chorus level
        implemented according to SoundFont 2.01 specification:
        8.4.9 MIDI Continuous Controller 93 to Chorus Effects Send
        Amount equals to 200 tenths of a percent
        that is, 127 gives 20% chorus increase
  94 - celeste level [under development]
  95 - phaser level [under development]
  96 - data increment
  97 - data decrement
  98 - NRPN lsb fine
  99 - NRPN msb coarse
  100 - RPN lsb fine
  101 - RPN msb coarse
  120 - all sounds off [terminate all notes]
  121 - reset all controllers
         the following controlles aren't reset (according to MIDI specification):
         7 (Volume),
         10 (Pan),
