<h3>WinXP/2k installation</h3>

<h4>

<p>This document is based on e-mails and messages from Trypt0. It is recommended that you try
running <b>kxsetup</b> <i>before</i> any manual installations, because the recent kxsetup versions
should work without any problems.</p>

<p>To install this driver manually under Windows XP or Windows 2000, first download both the latest
kX Audio Driver and the debug MFC libraries.</p>

<p>Don't forget to uninstall LiveWare and/or APS drivers. You may keep PlayCenter or
other Creative software.</p>

<p>Next, unRAR the driver onto any temporary directory and unRAR the MFC libraries to
your \windows\system32 (\winnt\system32) directory.</p>

<p>After extracting, go to Safe Mode by rebooting the computer and quickly pressing F8 as soon as it passes the POST test.</p>

<p>You should now be in Windows XP Safe Mode.</p>

<p>Now press Windows button and the Pause key at the same time; click the Hardware tab; 
click Device Manager; double-click "Sound, Video and Game Controllers"; double-click the device 
soundcard; click on the Driver tab; click on the "Update Driver" button; click Install from a 
List or Specific Location, click "don't search, I will choose"; click on the Have Disk button 
and find your drivers on the desktop (or temporary directory); find the appropriate driver 
for your model.
