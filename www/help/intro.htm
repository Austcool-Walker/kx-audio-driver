        The <b>kX Project</b> is an independent development project, focused on 
        providing free WDM Audio Drivers for kX-Compatible sound cards. Read our 
        <? klink("mission"); ?>Mission</a> statement for a quick introduction.
        </p>

        <p>The <b>kX Audio Driver</b> is an independent WDM (Windows Driver Model) 
        driver for all EMU10K1 and 
        EMU10K2-based soundcards manufactured by Creative Technology Ltd. and/or 
        E-mu Systems Inc., including the SoundBlaster Live! series, the E-mu Audio 
        Production Studio (APS) card, and the Audigy / Audigy2 series of cards.
        (<? klink("faq","cards"); ?>Full List</a>).<br><br>
        The kX Audio Driver package includes driver system files and setup files as well 
        as a powerful audio mixer application (the kX Mixer), which acts as a 
        Graphical User Interface, providing access to many of the driver's internal 
        functions. The following features are either fully supported or partially supported in 
        the latest release of the kX Audio Driver: 
         <ul>
                  <li>Wave Recording & Playback</li>
                  <li>MIDI Synthesizer (Soundfont-based) and MIDI UART In/Out</li>
                  <li>DirectSound 2D and DirectSound 3D</li>
                  <li>Full ASIO and GSIF support</li>
                  <li>DSP Microcode Loading/Unloading</li>
                  <li>Full AC97 codec control</li>
                  <li>AC3 Software Decoding</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The <b>kX Driver</b> is FREE and will remain FREE. Please note that you can <i>always</i> encourage development by making a donation to the 
        <?klink("fund");?>kX Fund</a>.
              As one of our contributors has pointed out, if all satisfied kX users 
              made even a very modest donation (say $10 each), it would go a long way 
              towards deferring our costs and would further encourage development of new 
              features (and elimination of old bugs).
