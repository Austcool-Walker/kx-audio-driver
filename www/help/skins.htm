<p>Skins can be used with the kX Mixer</p>

<!-- <? echo "--"; echo ">"; } echo "<!--"; ?>-->

<p>The kX Skin architecture was created in order to facilitate the creation of skins for kX mixer. The basic procedure for creating skins is as follows:<br>

<ul>
 <li>If you do not intend to add or relocate any controls, then you can simply create your own .zip / .rar file with modified .jpg and/or .gif images, and create a custom kxskin.ini file with only one section, called '[skin]', which describes your new skin. Don't forget to add kxskin.ini to your zip archive. Your new zip file can be placed anywhere on your hard disk. It's name <i>should not be</i> kxskin.kxs and you should replace 'GUID' by a new one, generated by kX Mixer (Settings->Generate GUID). (GUID means Globally Unique IDentifier).</li>
 <li>If your skin requires changes to window sizes or placement, you will have to create a more sophisticated kxskin.ini file. Refer to the included kxskin.ini example for details. However, if any settings are omitted from your custom kxskin.ini, they will be automatically retrieved from the default kxskin.ini that comes bundled with the kX mixer. Therefore, you are only required to provide your custom settings in your kxskin.ini file (including at a minimum the '[skin]' section). Note that images (.jpg/.gif files) and wave files (.wav) are now automatically retrieved from the default kxskin.kxs when using a custom mixer skin (since version 3514).</li>
 <li>In general, the image and wave filenames referenced by kxskin.ini should not be changed, nor should you modify the text strings (in fact you may ommit them from your custom kxskin.ini). However, if you plan to localize kX mixer, please drop us an e-mail.</li>
 <li>Once you have created your custom skin images, they should be zipped / rared together with your custom kxskin.ini file, into a zip file with a unique filename and with unique GUID. To use the skin, simply click 'Skin'->'Add Skin'.</li>
 <li>Note also that the skin name should be unique.</li>
 <li>In order to use these skins you should have at least version 3509 of the kX Software.</li>
 <li>Since 3521 you can use RAR archives instead of ZIP. However, avoid using solid archives, because this may reduce the overall performance.</li>
 <li>Since 3523 locale-dependent information is stored in lang.ini file. Do not include this file with your custom skin.</li>
 <li>Note that all the files not found in your custom skin are automatically retrieved from the default skin. For instance, you may successfully omit .wav files in your custom skin.</li>
</ul>
