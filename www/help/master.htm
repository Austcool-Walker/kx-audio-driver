<p>The kX Mixer Master control page provides access to the following level controls and buttons:</p>
<p><b><img  src="images/master.gif" width="45" height="30" > Master Volume</b><br> This stereo slider pair controls the overall playback level.</p>
<p><b><img  src="images/wave.gif" width="45" height="30" > PCM Wave Volume</b><br>This stereo slider pair controls the PCI Wave source playback level.</p>
<p><b><img  src="images/synth.gif" width="45" height="30"> MIDI Synth Volume</b><br>This stereo slider pair controls the MIDI Synth source playback level.</p>
<p><b><img  src="images/spsetup_button.gif" width="45" height="30" > Speaker Setup</b><br>This button opens 'Surrounder' effect settings (Surrounder is uploaded by default). Refer to <a href="surrounder.htm">Surrounder guide</a> for details.</p>
<p><b><img  src="images/doo_s.gif" width="70" height="32"> Digital Output Only</b><br>This button toggles Digital Output Only (DOO) mode for EMU10k1-based cards, and allows simultaneous recording of multiple analog sources, such as Line In, CD Audio, Auxiliary In and TAD In. With Digital Output Only active, a digital output device is required for monitoring (except for Audigy cards, which are considered as always being in DOO mode thus allowing multiple analog sources to be recorded).</p>
<p><b><img  src="images/swap_o.gif" width="70" height="32" > Swap Front and Rear</b><br>The Swap Front and Rear Output toggle button is used to improve analog sound quality by taking advantage of the superior DAC <a href="rear.htm">used for the rear speaker</a> (note that speakers are swapped by default). Not available to APS cards because they don't have AC97 Codec.</p>
<p><b><img  src="images/bypass_o.gif" width="70" height="32" > SPDIF Bypass</b><br>The SPDIF Bypass toggle button silences SPDIF digital output (for both 10k1 and 10k2 cards - not tested, but it should work).</p>
<p><b><img  src="images/ph2csw_o.gif" width="70" height="32" > Route Headphones to Center/SubWoofer</b><br>The Route Headphones to Center/SubWoofer toggle button can be used to divert headphone output to the center/subwoofer channel.</p>
<p><b><img  src="images/spdif_freq.gif" width="97" height="64" > SPDIF Frequency</b><br>This sample rate pull-down sets the frequency for SPDIF digital output (10k2 cards only). Choices are 44100, 48000 (default) and 96000, measured in samples per second. This setting will not affect internal sample frequency which is always locked by hardware at 48000.</p>
