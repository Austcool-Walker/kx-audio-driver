<p><b>Notes</b><br>
That no matter what configuration of speakers you use, it is recommended to put to 5.1 surround sound speakers or Surround sound speakers (depending on available choice) in Windows Control Panel. Speaker setup you have is not important - kX Speaker Test will always show all the available speakers [depending on your hardware: 4 or 5.1], but you can use 'Surrounder', 'downmix', 'surround' or 'cnv51to20' effects in the kX DSP to make mixing match your speaker setup.<br>
You can access the <a href="surrounder.htm">'Surrounder'</a> effect (which is uploaded by default) using <img  src="images/spsetup_button.gif" width="45" height="30" > button in kX Mixer.</p>
