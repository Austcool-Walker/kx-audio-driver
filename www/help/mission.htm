<h3>Mission</h3>

<h4>

<p>Our mission is to allow end-users unfettered access to all hardware features of the 
kX-compatible<!-- <? echo("--"); echo(">"); klink("faq","cards"); echo("<!--"); ?>-->*</a> 
soundcards, to promote the development of supporting applications
and to encourage a free exchange of information useful 
towards furthering software development for all kX-compatible soundcards. 
Our motto is: "Expanding the Potential Exponentially".</p>

<p class=Darken><b>Historical background</b></p>

<p>The kX Project was born out of a perceived need to expand the possiblities for use 
by musicians of the kX-compatible soundcards, under new and emerging operating systems 
which no longer support the old VxD device driver model.</p>

<p>Until now, musicians interested in exploring the detailed operational aspects of 
their Emu10k1 and 10k2-based soundcards have been limited to either working with 
the drivers that came with their cards<!--(drivers which have had their functionality 
severely limited by the manufacturer)-->, or installing superior VxD drivers originally 
intended for the E-mu Systems APS (Audio Production Studio) card, but being unable to 
upgrade to newer operating 
systems. In some cases, demanding users have decided to change operating systems 
altogether, i.e. to linux, or to limit the use of their 10kx soundcards to tasks such 
as gameplaying and SoundFont playback. </p>

<p><!--Understanding the need, and with the open-source linux drivers providing a working 
model, a-->An independent developer set out in the spring of 2001 to write the WDM drivers 
that would put the power back into the hands of the end-user, and throw open the door 
to practically unlimited software development for the 10kx cards. This intrepid and 
unrelentless developer was Eugene Gavrilov, who continues to spearhead the kX Driver 
programming effort.</p>

<p>A small team of independent testers and developers has now joined Eugene to continue 
kX Project development. Working together we can and will Expand the Potential and allow 
end-users unprecedented control over their soundcards and develop tools for musicians 
by musicians.<!--, without concern for market share or the bottom line.--></p>
