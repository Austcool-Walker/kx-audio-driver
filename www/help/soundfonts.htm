<p>kX Mixer provides the ability to load SoundFonts for MIDI Synth playback.</p>
<p>Load SoundFonts by clicking the Upload icon <img  src="images/sfload_o.gif" width="20" height="20" > on the SoundFont page. This will open a browse dialog; select a SoundFont file to upload (extension .SF2).</p>
<p>Currently loaded SoundFonts are listed in the upper pane. Selecting a listed SoundFont will cause SoundFont information to be displayed in the lower pane, including Name, Engine, Copyright, Engineer and Statistics.</p>
<p>Memory Usage is displayed in the Memory Usage Bar at the bottom of the SoundFont page.</p>
<p>To unload a SoundFont, select it in the upper pane, then click on the Unload icon.<img  src="images/quit.gif" width="19" height="20" ></p>
<p>The kX driver supports the loading of SoundFont 2.0 and 2.1 files only (as well as sfArk v2.0 or higher); the SoundFont 1.0 format (.SBK) is not supported. Note that there is currently no support for SF2.1 Modulator properties.</p>
<p>There is also an option of saving <img  src="images/sfcsave.gif" width="30" height="25" > and loading <img  src="images/sfcload.gif" width="30" height="25" > SoundFont collection.</p>
<p>The kX WDM driver assigns SoundFont cache memory on-demand; there is no user-adjustable cache control. In theory, the maximum loadable SoundFont filesize is limited only by system resources, however this maximum will vary between 30% and 70% of physical RAM, due kernel memory limitations and depending on many factors. In any event, only 32MB of samples can be played back at any one time, due to hardware limitations.</p>
